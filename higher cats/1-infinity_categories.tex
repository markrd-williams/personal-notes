We will start with a definition which is not of an $\infty$-category, but a weaker notion.
In particular these will be a simplicial set with composition, but the space of composers isn't necessarily contractible.

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{composer} is a simplicial set with the extension property against spine inclusions $I^n \to \Delta^n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    The singular set of a topological space is a composer.
    Given paths $p_i : x_i \to x_{i+1}$, the data of a spine map, we define their composition as the composition of the paths.
    If you aren't convinced this gives an actual $n$-cell, there is some way to see this either purely topologically, or by inductively filling $2$-horns, $3$-horns, etc. until you get a full filler of $\Delta^n$, using 
\end{example}
